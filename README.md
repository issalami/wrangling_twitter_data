 Wrangle and Analyse WeRateDogs Twitter Data
This project illustrates methods to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
The dataset used in this notebook is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people’s dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? 
Because “they’re good dogs Brent.” WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage
